opener: America's Favorite Diner now gives you America's Favorite Breakfast Sweethearts. Pancake, Bacon, Egg, and Sausage made their debut on YouTube &amp; Tumblr but eventually needed a home they could call their own. We pull in data from YouTube and Tumblr and also give each character a page of their own so fans can get to know them. It's goofy, sure, but the Denny's-faithful have accepted the Slams into their hearts, or basements.<br/>This site was a lot of fun to work on. Specifically I enjoyed building interaction/animation details and diving deep into scroll performance as there is a lot asked of the browser on scroll on severl pages. The scroll effets were a challenge.
