  paragraph: Denny's Diner is America's Favorite Diner. Once Denny's created America's favorite breakfast food personifications, The Grand Slams, they need a home of their own on the web. Denny's does an exceptional job Tweeting and Tumblr-ing, so creating and hosting additional web content for them wassn't taken lightly. TheGrandSlams.com hosts the The Grand Slams' mini-series that introduces Denny's and cartoon fans alike, to the foursome. The site pulls in their posts from Tumblr, videos from YouTube and gives their own page to be showcased. <br>This site was a lot of fun to work on. Specifically I enjoyed building interaction/animation details and diving deep into scroll performance as there is a lot asked of the browser on scroll on some of the pages.

  paragraph: As the online bank, CIT Bank, got themselves a new brand, they got a new website as well. Leading a small team, I built the bones of this 75+ page static site using Middleman App. There are 12 templates in place and exceptions all over the place. Although the project went through a could deaths and ressurections, the site turned out really nice and a major step above competitors' marketing sites. The Interactive Media Awards agreed, awarding bankoncit.com Best in Class in web design and development. That felt nice.
