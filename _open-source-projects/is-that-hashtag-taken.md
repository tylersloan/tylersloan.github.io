This is sort of silly, but it was an excercise in APIs and Ruby/Sinatra.

I was sitting with friends on a buddy's wedding day while everyone tried to figure out what his hashtag should be. We wanted to know if "that one" had been taken yet so I though, "Hey, I bet I can make an app to just look these words up on whatever social media site." I stopped with Instagram and Twitter because it's my little thing and that's all I cared about.
