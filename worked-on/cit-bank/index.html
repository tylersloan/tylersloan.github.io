opener: As the online bank, CIT Bank, got themselves a new brand, they got a new website as well. Leading a small team, I built the bones of this 75+ page static site using Middleman App. There are 12 templates in place and exceptions all over the place. Although the project went through a could deaths and ressurections, the site turned out really nice and a major step above competitors' marketing sites. The Interactive Media Awards agreed, awarding bankoncit.com Best in Class in web design and development. That felt nice.
