opener: I'm actually still working on this. Well, it hasn't launched yet, anyway. I really want to show it to you though. I'm really proud of this site for a few reasons.<ol><li>Although there were no performance requirements, I was able to exceed performance goals I set on a personal level.</li><li>I feel like I leveled up my front-end skills across the board while making this site fast.</li><li>I was able to delegate almost all HTML and CSS over to my teammate and I didn't lose any sleep over it. She knocked it out of the park.</li></ol>
