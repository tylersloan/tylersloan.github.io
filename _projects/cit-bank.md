As this project got underway, I was so excited to be able to lead a small team to success on a 100+ page static site. I chose Middleman App as the generator and had a lot of fun and learned a lot about .erb and a little about Ruby helpers and such.

<br>

It was a very exciting time in the Spring/Summer of 2014â€“support for IE8 was offical kaput. This meant I could drop icon fonts and PNGs and reaplce them with SVGs! How cool! I learned a lot about the ins-and-outs of SVG regarding browser compatibility and quirks.

<br>

One of the coolest things going on on this site is something I barely helped on, if at all, actually. A really smart teammate wrote a function that transforms these stickey-rowed, comparison tables into dropdown accordions at a certain breakpoint. HTML Semantics and Responsive Web Design!

Getting this website complete was a roller-coaster ride including project stalls, content stalls, and iteration after iteration, but in the end we were able to deliver a really nice website that helps a lot of people make wise investment decisions and has won CIT Bank several awards for outstanding web design and development in the banking industry.
