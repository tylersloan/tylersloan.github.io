Designing and building yourself a portfolio is known to be one of the hardest things designers and agencies alike just have to do. At Erwin Penland, finding good content isn't hard but choosing the right stuff to show off just who they are and what they can do was no easy task. After a rebranding and a re-centering of sorts, a new ErwinPenland.com was launched and features a few of the best case studies along with insight on how they create, and introductions of the senior management.

Finding the right amount of content mixed with a elegant amount of "ohhs" and "ahhs" was challenging. This project was full of personal, techincal, and group victories that resulted in a delightful website and a collective sigh of relief.
