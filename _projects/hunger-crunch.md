When Bryan Martin, friend and designer at Rice Bowls, makes of Hunger Crunch, asked me to build the website for the video game, I said yes with a quickness. Bryan is a fantastic designer and a lot of fun to be around. We spent every bit of the week set aside to get this done, batting around ideas and finding solutions to get his design feeling just right on the web. Hunger Crunch is a really fun video game (web, iOS, Android) that uses 100% of the money from in-app purchases to pay for food to feed hungry orphans where the need is greatest.
