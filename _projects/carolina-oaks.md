I was able to work with the amazing design studio, Shed Labs, to deliver a beautiful, digestable brochure website for Carolina Oaks dentistry. The site doesn't do anything it shouldn't. It does deliver everything it should–dentists, locations, hours, and contact information, including a form that can be used to initiate an appointment.

<br/>

With a growing number of locations, this site makes it super-easy for visitors to figure out which location is most convenient, how to contact them, and who the in-office dentists are. Their goal to make everyone feel welcome and invited into their office was one I was happy to help with.
