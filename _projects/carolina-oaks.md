No, you still can't go to the dentist online, but at least it's easy to set up an appointment now.

<br/>

I was able to work with the amazing design studio, Shed Labs, to deliver a really beautiful, digestable brochure website for Carolina Oaks dentistry. The site doesn't do anything you shouldn't epect and delivers everything it should–dentists, locations, hours, and contact information, including a form that can be sued to initiate an appointment.

<br/>

With a growing number of locations, this site makes it super-easy for visitors to figure out which location is most convenient, how to contact them, and even who the in-office dentists are. Their goal to make everyone feel welcome and invited into their office was one I was happy to help with.
