No, you still can't go to the dentist online, but you sure can set up an appointment there.

I was able to work with the amazing design studio, Shed Labs, to deliver a really beautiful, digestable brochure website for Carolina Oaks dentistry.

<br/>

With a growing number of locations, this site makes it super-easy for visitors to figure out which location is most convenient, how to contact them, and even who the in-office dentists are. Their goal to make everyone feel welcome and invited into their office was one I was happy to help with.
