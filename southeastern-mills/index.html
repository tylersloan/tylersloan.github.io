opener: The super-fast, fairly light, and all new Southeastern Mills website is just about to launch. I can't wait to share this project for a few reasons, mostly related to performance.<ol><li>Although there were no performance requirements, I was able to exceed performance goals I set for myself.</li><li>I learned about the web's History API.</li><li>Accessibility was a priority.</li><li>I feel like I leveled up my front-end skills across the board while making this site fast.</li></ol>
