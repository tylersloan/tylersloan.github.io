#### I'm writing this on github.com.

I blew up npm but running `$ npm install -g npm`. It felt weird when typing it and it immediately broke npm.

`$ zsh: command not found: npm`

I've tried a few things to fix it but no luck. I'm usually pretty good at figuring these sorts of things out by Googling errors. I found  a [gist](https://gist.github.com/DanHerbert/9520689) that seemed helpful but wasn't.

All that started because I was trying to clone and angular sample app to investigate the file structure and index.html. Yep, that means I'm pretty much done with the (non-)design. It has taken a little too long to make 3 or 4 tiny, unstyled templates, but I'm on vacation. I was going to take screen shots to show but now I can't even run gulp.

`$ zsh: command not found: gulp`

Development is complicated. I'm going to the beach.
