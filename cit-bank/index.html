opener: CIT Bank, (CIT Group subsidiary and online bank), offers a suite of banking products designed to help customers achieve a range of financial goals. We built a site that shows off everything the bank has to offer, and to our delight, shows off award-winning design and developement to boot. The site launched around The Fall of IE8 so it was fun getting to use SVG in a new way without a lot of extra work. I lead a small groupd of developers that tag-teamed much of the design features while I handled code architecture, code reviews, and dev-ops.
