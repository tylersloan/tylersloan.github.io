# My Personal Site

## Site Info
* Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) utilizing [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to deploy easily on GitHub Pages
* The green color is the franken-hex value of my wife's birthday. 
* Code and copy is open source, so if you see something wrong and want to be a pal, [open an issue](https://github.com/tylersloan/tylersloan.github.io/issues/new) and/or submit a PR.

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://0.0.0.0:4000
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

## Contributing

Like I said earlier, if something on the site is just wrong, factually, gramatically, or otherwise, feel free to let me know. I'm also open to design pull-requests. I'm not a great designerâ€“my feelings won't be hurt fi something ought to change. This site isn't an open-source project that'll get you any sort of points, but I'd appreciate it and it'll get you another green square on your activity chart. Thanks!
