opener: Hunger Crunch is a multi-device game built by an exceptional in-house team of designers and developer at Rice Bowls, made to fight world hunger. A tight deadline made building this fun and friendly site an exciting adventure. I worked closely with the designers and we iterated over the important details until everything was just right. This is one I was really proud to be a part of.
