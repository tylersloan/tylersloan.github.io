    <h4>Simply, to document building this: <a href="https://github.com/tylersloan/cookbook-app">Cookbook repo on Github</a>, but hear me out, if you want...</h4>

<p>It was April, 2013.</p>

<p>I was a few weeks into a frontend programming program (<a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a>) when I sketched some app screens that would become my class project. I got this far (<a href="https://github.com/theironyard/batchmaker">Batchmaker repo on Github</a>) on the project with help from classmates and the instructor.</p>

<p>Not bad, right?</p>

<p>After the program ran its course, and I started working for money. It&#39;s easier to make money as a beginner writing HTML &amp; CSS so I did that. The work was available, I enjoyed it, and I wanted to get be better at it. I needed to focus on doing just that so I chose to put Batchmaker down.</p>

<p>Batchmaker is a a first love of mine–it&#39;s weird, sure. The idea wasn&#39;t mine, but I latched onto it. I drew the wireframes and the class constructed the design all together. It was a lot of fun and I was looking forward to watching my wife (and my mom) use the app. I spent a lot of time getting maybe a third there before quitting. I feel like I let some people down by not finishing, but mostly myself. I don&#39;t regret the work I&#39;ve done the last 2 years–it&#39;s been a really amazing journey. I&#39;m pretty damn good at writing HTML, CSS, and JS. I do it a lot. Like all day everyday. It&#39;s satisfying, but nothing produces quite the same gratification as making data show up on the page. It&#39;s just really cool to me. Probably mundane to many at this point, but I&#39;m just 2 years into the game and the stuff is still just cool.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think of Batchmaker a few times a month, still. I&#39;m feeling motivated and the time is feeling a lot like &#39;now&#39; to get back on the horse.</p>

<p>Actually, I&#39;m starting over. I didn&#39;t even use the name &quot;Batchmaker&quot; in my new repo. The old repo is open-sourced by TIY–I just figured it easiest to start fresh. That old repo hasn&#39;t been touched in 660 days at the time I wrote this. I&#39;m sure the markup and CSS sucks, and I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t document or use comments in my Javascript so what&#39;s the point? I&#39;m doing this because I want to, but also because I need to level up my programming rep. I&#39;ve been doing so much frontend design that I don&#39;t even feel close to being able to call myself a programmer. Don&#39;t mean to step on toes–I think you now what I mean.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ve given myself 3 months to get a prototype working (June 1 - August 31). I will be successful if, with the app, a user can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create an account/log in</li>
<li>Edit their profile</li>
<li>Create a recipe</li>
<li>Open the recipe(s) individually</li>
<li>Edit the recipe(s)</li>
<li>Delete the recipe(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anything more will be icing. I&#39;m going to try to not over-design and get slowed down in that area along the way but I probably will.</p>

<p>Your basic CRUD app, right? We&#39;ll see. I don&#39;t know what JS framework I will use. I don&#39;t know what backend engine I&#39;ll run it on. Right now I&#39;m just looking over 2 year old designs and making one page at time. After that I&#39;ll have chosen a framework and begin integrated the new markup into that system.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be recording successes and failures alike. I&#39;m really looking forward to the next few months. Again, <a href="https://github.com/tylersloan/cookbook-app">here&#39;s the repo for &#39;cookbook-app&#39;</a> (my wife helped me choose that codename). Also, <a href="https://github.com/tylersloan/tyler-works">here&#39;s the repo for this little Jekyll site</a>, in case I made a typo or something and you&#39;re the kind that likes to help.</p>
