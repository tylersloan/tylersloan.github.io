    <meta name="description" content="As this project got underway, I was so excited to be able to lead a small team to success on a 100+ page static site. I chose Middleman App as the generator and had a lot of fun and learned a lot about .erb and a little about Ruby helpers and such.



It was a very exciting time in the Spring/Summer of 2014–support for IE8 was offically kaput. This meant I could drop icon fonts and PNGs and reaplce them with SVGs! How cool! I learned a lot about the ins-and-outs of SVG regarding browser compatibility and quirks.



I played the part of site architect and senior developer. I built out a style guide and put plans in place for the team to produce all the asked-for pages in a short amount of time.



One of the coolest things going on on this site is something I barely helped on, if at all, actually. A really smart teammate wrote a function that transforms these comparison tables into dropdown accordions at a certain breakpoint. HTML Semantics and Responsive Web Design! It just works.



Getting this website complete was a roller-coaster ride including project stalls, content delays, and iteration after iteration. In the end we delivered an award-winning website that helps a lot of people make wise investment decisions.
