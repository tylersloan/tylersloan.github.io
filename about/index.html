	<h5>I'm Tyler Sloan; but you know that.</h5>

	<p>I am a front-end engineer.</p>
	<p>I'm still confused about job titles. I build the parts of the web that users see, and some parts that they don't.</p>

	<p>Here's a list of reasons I love my job:  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>I love building sites that web browsers (humans) enjoy using.</li>
		<li>I love building sites that web browsers (web browsers) are able to render quickly and easily.</li>
		<li>I get to make design decisions, ie. interactions, animations, etc.</li>
		<li>It's sort of my job to keep learning about my job.</li>
		<li>My family thinks it's cool.</li>
	</ul>
