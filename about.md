	<p>That's a photo of me and my family at a seafood restaurant last summer. I live in Greenville, South Carolina and it is really lovely. I'm a software engineer at <a href="http://boomtownroi.com/" target="_blank">BoomTown</a>. I work with a really amazing team.</p>

	<h3>If you want to really read about me, here you go.</h3>
	<p>I am a front-end programmer with an eye for design that works. I graduated from The Iron Yard in 2013â€“I was a part of its inaugural class of seven. The Iron Yard has grown a lot since then and so have I.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
	<p>After graduating, I spent a few months working for myself before joining  <a href="https://robojuice.com" target="_blank">Robojuice</a>, a small but might web shop in Greenville. There I learned wrote tons of HTML and CSS (maybe too much ;]). After completeing several medium-large Wordpress themes with them, I moved on to the role of UX Developer at Erwin Penland.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
	<p>After that contract ran its course, I'd developed a good relationship with my boss and the team and I decided to go fulltime at the agency. Here, I have been building out the front end of applications and websites of all scales for the last year and a half.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
	<p>Over the last three years what I've learned the most is that, boy, front-end development can be hard and there is a lot to know and keep up with. It's tough. I typically choose one "focus" to level-up in during each project. In the past, that focus has been things like, SVG, .erb or Liquid templating engine, and web performance. Focusing on learning a lot about something I don't know much about helps me be always learning and helps me stay excited about building yet another website.</p>
