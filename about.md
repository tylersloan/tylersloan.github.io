### I'm Tyler Sloan; but that, you've surely reasoned by now.

I am front-end developer.  
Here's a list of reasons I love my job:  
<ul>
	<li>I love building sites that web browsers (humans) enjoy using.</li>
	<li>I love building sites that web browsers (web browsers) are able to render quickly and easily.</li>
	<li>I get to make design decisions, but I'm not *the* designer.</li>
	<li>I get to design interactions.</li>
</ul>
