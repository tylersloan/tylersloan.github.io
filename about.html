    ##### I'm Tyler Sloan; but you know that.

    I am a front-end engineer.
    I'm still confused about job titles. I build the parts of the web that users see, and some parts that they don't.

    Here's a list of reasons I love my job:  
    <ul>
        <li>I love building sites that web browsers (humans) enjoy using.</li>
        <li>I love building sites that web browsers (web browsers) are able to render quickly and easily.</li>
        <li>I get to make design decisions, ie. interactions, animations, etc.</li>
        <li>It's sort of my job to keep learning about my job.</li>
        <li>My family thinks it's cool.</li>
    </ul>
